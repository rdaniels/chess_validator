# ChessValidator

Solution to PuzzleNode http://www.puzzlenode.com/puzzles/13-chess-validator.
Chess move validator: given a list of moves and a board, this program determines whether each move is LEGAL or ILLEGAL.
I'm using RSpec and Guard for this project, which is a bit outside my comfort zone.

* Compatible with RSpec ~> 2.14
* Tested against Ruby 1.9.3

```
## Usage
