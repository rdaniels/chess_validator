# ChessValidator

Solution to PuzzleNode http://www.puzzlenode.com/puzzles/13-chess-validator.
Chess move validator: given a list of moves and a board, this program determines whether each move is LEGAL or ILLEGAL.

I'm trying out RSpec and TDD for this project, which is a bit outside my comfort zone.


## Usage

ruby chess_run
